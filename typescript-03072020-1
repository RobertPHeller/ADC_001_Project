[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file  copying  tool.   It
       can  copy  locally,  to/from  another  host  over  any remote shell, or
       to/from a remote rsync daemon.  It offers a  large  number  of  options
       that  control  every  aspect  of  its behavior and permit very flexible
       specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous  for  its
       delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the amount of data sent over
       the network by sending only the differences between  the  source  files
       and  the  existing  files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for
       backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

:[K[K       Rsync  finds  files  that  need to be transferred using a “quick check”
       algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed  in  size
       or   in  last-modified  time.   Any  changes  in  the  other  preserved
       attributes (as requested by options) are made on the  destination  file
       directly  when  the quick check indicates that the file’s data does not
       need to be updated.

       Some of the additional features of rsync are:

       o      support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and  permis-
              sions

       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar

       o      a  CVS  exclude  mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would
              ignore

       o      can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh

       o      does not require super-user privileges

       o      pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs

       o      support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal  for
              mirroring)

[1mGENERAL[0m
       Rsync  copies  files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the
       current host (it does not support  copying  files  between  two  remote
       hosts).

       There  are  two  different  ways  for rsync to contact a remote system:
:[K[K       using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or  rsh)  or
       contacting  an  rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell trans-
       port is used whenever the source or destination path contains a  single
       colon  (:)  separator  after a host specification.  Contacting an rsync
       daemon directly happens when the source or destination path contains  a
       double  colon  (::)  separator  after  a host specification, OR when an
       rsync:// URL is specified (see also the  “USING  RSYNC-DAEMON  FEATURES
       VIA  A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION” section for an exception to this latter
       rule).

       As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a desti-
       nation, the files are listed in an output format similar to “ls -l”.

       As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote
       host, the copy occurs locally (see also the [1m--list-only[0m option).

       Rsync refers to the local side as the “client” and the remote  side  as
       the  “server”.   Don’t confuse “server” with an rsync daemon — a daemon
       is always a server, but a server can be either a daemon  or  a  remote-
       shell spawned process.

[1mSETUP[0m
       See the file README for installation instructions.

       Once  installed,  you  can use rsync to any machine that you can access
       via a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync
       daemon-mode  protocol).   For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh
       for its communications, but it may have been configured to use  a  dif-
       ferent remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.

       You  can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the [1m-e[0m
       command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment  variable.
:[K[K
       Note  that  rsync  must be installed on both the source and destination
       machines.

[1mUSAGE[0m
       You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must  specify  a  source
       and a destination, one of which may be remote.

       Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:

              rsync -t *.c foo:src/

       This would transfer all files matching the pattern *.c from the current
       directory to the directory src on the machine foo. If any of the  files
       already  exist on the remote system then the rsync remote-update proto-
       col is used to update the file by sending only the differences. See the
       tech report for details.

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp

       This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on
       the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local  machine.
       The  files  are  transferred in “archive” mode, which ensures that sym-
       bolic links, devices, attributes,  permissions,  ownerships,  etc.  are
       preserved  in  the transfer.  Additionally, compression will be used to
       reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.

              rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp

       A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid  creating
       an  additional  directory level at the destination.  You can think of a
       trailing / on a source as meaning “copy the contents of this directory”
:[K[K       as  opposed  to  “copy  the  directory  by name”, but in both cases the
       attributes of the containing directory are transferred to the  contain-
       ing  directory on the destination.  In other words, each of the follow-
       ing commands copies the files in the same way, including their  setting
       of the attributes of /dest/foo:

              rsync -av /src/foo /dest
              rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo

       Note  also  that  host  and  module references don’t require a trailing
       slash to copy the contents of the default directory.  For example, both
       of these copy the remote directory’s contents into “/dest”:

              rsync -av host: /dest
              rsync -av host::module /dest

       You  can  also  use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and
       destination don’t have a ‘:’ in the name. In this case it behaves  like
       an improved copy command.

       Finally,  you can list all the (listable) modules available from a par-
       ticular rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:

              rsync somehost.mydomain.com::

       See the following section for more details.

[1mADVANCED[0m [1mUSAGE[0m
       The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host is done  by
       specifying  additional remote-host args in the same style as the first,
       or with the hostname omitted.  For instance, all these work:

:[K[K              rsync -av host:file1 :file2 host:file{3,4} /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file{1,2} host::modname/file3 /dest/
              rsync -av host::modname/file1 ::modname/file{3,4}

       Older versions of rsync required using quoted spaces in the  SRC,  like
       these examples:

              rsync -av host:’dir1/file1 dir2/file2’ /dest
              rsync host::’modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2’ /dest

       This  word-splitting  still works (by default) in the latest rsync, but
       is not as easy to use as the first method.

       If you need to transfer a filename that contains  whitespace,  you  can
       either specify the [1m--protect-args[0m ([1m-s[0m) option, or you’ll need to escape
       the whitespace in a way that the remote  shell  will  understand.   For
       instance:

              rsync -av host:’file\ name\ with\ spaces’ /dest

       It  is  also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the trans-
       port.  In this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync daemon,
       typically  using  TCP port 873.  (This obviously requires the daemon to
       be running on the remote system, so refer to the STARTING AN RSYNC DAE-
       MON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS section below for information on that.)

       Using  rsync  in  this  way is the same as using it with a remote shell
       except that:

       o      you either use a double colon :: instead of a  single  colon  to
              separate the hostname from the path, or you use an rsync:// URL.
:[K[K
       o      the first word of the “path” is actually a module name.

       o      the remote daemon may print a message of the day when  you  con-
              nect.

       o      if  you  specify no path name on the remote daemon then the list
              of accessible paths on the daemon will be shown.

       o      if you specify no local destination then a listing of the speci-
              fied files on the remote daemon is provided.

       o      you must not specify the [1m--rsh[0m ([1m-e[0m) option.

       An example that copies all the files in a remote module named “src”:

           rsync -av host::src /dest

       Some  modules  on  the remote daemon may require authentication. If so,
       you will receive a password prompt when you connect. You can avoid  the
       password  prompt  by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to
       the password you want to use or using the [1m--password-file[0m option.  This
       may be useful when scripting rsync.

       WARNING:  On  some  systems  environment  variables  are visible to all
       users. On those systems using [1m--password-file[0m is recommended.

       You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting  the  envi-
       ronment  variable  RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to your
       web proxy.  Note that your web proxy’s configuration must support proxy
       connections to port 873.

:[K[K       You  may  also establish a daemon connection using a program as a proxy
       by setting the environment variable RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG to the  commands
       you  wish  to  run  in place of making a direct socket connection.  The
       string may contain the escape “%H” to represent the hostname  specified
       in  the  rsync  command  (so  use “%%” if you need a single “%” in your
       string).  For example:

         export RSYNC_CONNECT_PROG=’ssh proxyhost nc %H 873’
         rsync -av targethost1::module/src/ /dest/
         rsync -av rsync:://targethost2/module/src/ /dest/

       The command specified above uses ssh to run nc (netcat) on a proxyhost,
       which  forwards all data to port 873 (the rsync daemon) on the targeth-
       ost (%H).

       It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such
       as  named modules) without actually allowing any new socket connections
       into a system (other than what is already  required  to  allow  remote-
       shell  access).   Rsync  supports  connecting  to a host using a remote
       shell and then spawning a single-use “daemon” server  that  expects  to
       read  its  config file in the home dir of the remote user.  This can be
       useful if you want to encrypt a daemon-style transfer’s data, but since
       the  daemon is started up fresh by the remote user, you may not be able
       to use features such as chroot or change the uid used  by  the  daemon.
       (For  another  way  to encrypt a daemon transfer, consider using ssh to
       tunnel a local port to a remote machine and configure  a  normal  rsync
       daemon on that remote host to only allow connections from “localhost”.)

       From the user’s perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell  con-
       nection uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal rsync-dae-
       mon transfer, with the only exception being that  you  must  explicitly
:[K[K       set the remote shell program on the command-line with the [1m--rsh=COMMAND[0m
       option.  (Setting the RSYNC_RSH in the environment  will  not  turn  on
       this functionality.)  For example:

           rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest

       If you need to specify a different remote-shell user, keep in mind that
       the user@ prefix in front of the  host  is  specifying  the  rsync-user
       value  (for  a  module  that requires user-based authentication).  This
       means that you must give the ’-l user’ option to  ssh  when  specifying
       the remote-shell, as in this example that uses the short version of the
       [1m--rsh[0m option:

           rsync -av -e "ssh -l ssh-user" rsync-user@host::module /dest

       In order to connect to an rsync daemon, the remote system needs to have
       a daemon already running (or it needs to have configured something like
       inetd to spawn an rsync daemon for incoming connections on a particular
       port).  For full information on how to start a daemon  that  will  han-
       dling  incoming  socket  connections, see the [1mrsyncd.conf[0m(5) man page —
       that is the config file for  the  daemon,  and  it  contains  the  full
       details for how to run the daemon (including stand-alone and inetd con-
       figurations).

       If you’re using one of the remote-shell transports  for  the  transfer,
       there is no need to manually start an rsync daemon.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
:[K[K       Here are some examples of how I use rsync.

       To  backup  my  wife’s  home directory, which consists of large MS Word
       files and mail folders, I use a cron job that runs

              rsync -Cavz . arvidsjaur:backup

       each night over a PPP connection to a duplicate directory on my machine
       “arvidsjaur”.

       To  synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile tar-
       gets:

           get:
                   rsync -avuzb --exclude ’*~’ samba:samba/ .
           put:
                   rsync -Cavuzb . samba:samba/
           sync: get put

       this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the  other  end  of  the
       connection. I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which saves
       a lot of time as the remote CVS protocol isn’t very efficient.

       I mirror a directory between my “old” and “new” ftp sites with the com-
       mand:

       rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"

       This is launched from cron every few hours.

       rsync  uses  the  GNU  long  options  package. Many of the command line
       options have two variants, one short and one  long.   These  are  shown
       below, separated by commas. Some options only have a long variant.  The
       ‘=’ for options that take a parameter is optional;  whitespace  can  be
       used instead.

       [1m-v,[0m [1m--verbose[0m
              This option increases the amount of information  you  are  given
              during the transfer.  By default, rsync works silently. A single
              [1m-v[0m will give you information about what files are  being  trans-
              ferred  and a brief summary at the end. Two [1m-v[0m options will give
              you information on what files are  being  skipped  and  slightly
              more  information  at  the  end. More than two [1m-v[0m options should
              only be used if you are debugging rsync.

              Note that the names of the transferred files that are output are
              done  using  a  default  [1m--out-format[0m of “%n%L”, which tells you
              just the name of the file and, if the item is a link,  where  it
              points.  At the single [1m-v[0m level of verbosity, this does not men-
              tion when a file gets its attributes changed.  If you ask for an
              itemized list of changed attributes (either [1m--itemize-changes[0m or
:[K[K              adding “%i” to the [1m--out-format[0m setting),  the  output  (on  the
              client)  increases  to mention all items that are changed in any
              way.  See the [1m--out-format[0m option for more details.

       [1m-q,[0m [1m--quiet[0m
              This option decreases the amount of information  you  are  given
              during  the  transfer,  notably suppressing information messages
              from the remote server. This  option  is  useful  when  invoking
              rsync from cron.

       [1m--no-motd[0m
              This option affects the information that is output by the client
              at the start of a daemon transfer.  This suppresses the message-
              of-the-day  (MOTD) text, but it also affects the list of modules
              that the daemon sends in response to the “rsync host::”  request
              (due to a limitation in the rsync protocol), so omit this option
              if you want to request the list of modules from the daemon.

       [1m-I,[0m [1m--ignore-times[0m
              Normally rsync will skip any files that  are  already  the  same
              size  and  have  the  same  modification timestamp.  This option
              turns off this “quick check” behavior, causing all files  to  be
              updated.

       [1m--size-only[0m
              This  modifies rsync’s “quick check” algorithm for finding files
              that need to be transferred, changing it  from  the  default  of
              transferring files with either a changed size or a changed last-
              modified time to just looking for files  that  have  changed  in
              size.   This  is  useful  when starting to use rsync after using
              another mirroring  system  which  may  not  preserve  timestamps
              exactly.
:[K[K
       [1m--modify-window[0m
              When  comparing  two  timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as
              being equal if they differ by no  more  than  the  modify-window
              value.   This  is  normally  0 (for an exact match), but you may
              find it useful to set this to a larger value in some situations.
              In  particular,  when  transferring to or from an MS Windows FAT
              filesystem (which represents times with a 2-second  resolution),
              [1m--modify-window=1[0m is useful (allowing times to differ by up to 1
              second).

       [1m-c,[0m [1m--checksum[0m
              This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed
              and  are in need of a transfer.  Without this option, rsync uses
              a “quick check” that (by default) checks if each file’s size and
              time of last modification match between the sender and receiver.
              This option changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for  each
              file  that  has a matching size.  Generating the checksums means
              that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O  reading  all  the
              data  in  the  files  in  the transfer (and this is prior to any
              reading that will be done to transfer changed  files),  so  this
              can slow things down significantly.

              The  sending  side generates its checksums while it is doing the
              file-system scan that builds the list of  the  available  files.
              The  receiver  generates  its  checksums when it is scanning for
              changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size
              as the corresponding sender’s file:  files with either a changed
              size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.

              Note that rsync always verifies that each [4mtransferred[24m  file  was
              correctly  reconstructed  on  the  receiving  side by checking a

       Rsync  copies  files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the
       current host (it does not support  copying  files  between  two  remote
       hosts).

       There  are  two  different  ways  for rsync to contact a remote system:
       using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or  rsh)  or
       contacting  an  rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell trans-
       port is used whenever the source or destination path contains a  single
       colon  (:)  separator  after a host specification.  Contacting an rsync
       daemon directly happens when the source or destination path contains  a
       double  colon  (::)  separator  after  a host specification, OR when an
       rsync:// URL is specified (see also the  “USING  RSYNC-DAEMON  FEATURES
       VIA  A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION” section for an exception to this latter
       rule).

       As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a desti-
       nation, the files are listed in an output format similar to “ls -l”.

       this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the  other  end  of  the
       connection. I then do CVS operations on the remote machine, which saves
       a lot of time as the remote CVS protocol isn’t very efficient.

       I mirror a directory between my “old” and “new” ftp sites with the com-
       mand:

       rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge"

       This is launched from cron every few hours.

              also  in  effect  (without  [1m--delete-[0m[1m[7mexclude[27m[0m[1md[0m), rsync will add a
              “protect” filter-rule for the backup suffix to the  end  of  all
              your existing [7mexclude[27ms (e.g. [1m-f[0m [1m"P[0m [1m*~"[0m).  This will prevent pre-
              viously backed-up files from being deleted.  Note  that  if  you
              are  supplying  your  own filter rules, you may need to manually
              insert your own [7mexclude[27m/protect rule somewhere higher up in  the
              list  so  that  it  has  a  high enough priority to be effective
              (e.g., if your rules specify a trailing  inclusion/exclusion  of
              ‘*’, the auto-added rule would never be reached).

       [1m--backup-dir=DIR[0m
              In  combination  with  the  [1m--backup[0m option, this tells rsync to
              store all backups in the specified directory  on  the  receiving
              side.   This can be used for incremental backups.  You can addi-
              tionally specify a backup suffix using the [1m--suffix[0m option (oth-
              erwise  the files backed up in the specified directory will keep
              their original filenames).

       [1m--suffix=SUFFIX[0m
              This option allows you to override  the  default  backup  suffix
              used with the [1m--backup[0m ([1m-b[0m) option. The default suffix is a ~ if
              no -[1m-backup-dir[0m was specified, otherwise it is an empty  string.

       [1m-u,[0m [1m--update[0m
              This  forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the destina-
              tion and have a modified time that  is  newer  than  the  source
              file.   (If an existing destination file has a modification time
              equal to the source file’s, it will be updated if the sizes  are
              different.)

              Note  that this does not affect the copying of symlinks or other
              special files.  Also, a difference of file  format  between  the
