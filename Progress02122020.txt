I compiled all four of the math library. No hacking needed -- just  installing
gfortran and cmake.

I created a repo: https://github.com/RobertPHeller/ADC_001_Project to hold any
code, notes, scripts, etc. 

I  forked  these  repos of  yours:  ADC-001_basic_code,  AnomalyDetector,  and
MusicPlaypen.  I also  cloned  them  down to my  beagle  bone.  I  managed  to
compile  your basic code, after making some mods to the  Makefile.  I commited
the changes and pushed them to my fork and put in a pull request.

At this point I am waiting on the arrival of the cape, tomorrow.
